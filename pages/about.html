    <h1 class="title">My dream</h1>
    <p class="dream-description">I have desired to create experiences for people to have outstanding websites.  I want everyone who visits them to know how things work, what expectations will come when browsing, and a sense of familiarity. There is nothing over the top about my designs (unless you desire unique).</p>
    <br>
    <p class="dream-description">I learned UX Design with Kenzie Academy.  Which created the passion to help businesses and clients create wonderful and memoriable websites. My experience is limited to class projects and daily challenges.  I aquired a BS in Game Programming and Development from SNHU, but my desire is to take my coding knowledge and utilized it for creative websites.  I love the idea of creating games so people can esacpe reality for a while. One of my greatest joys to sit in my game chair and loose for myself for hours, discovering unknow worlds and characters.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="dream-descrtiption">My true calling is helping people get the most out of technology in todays worlds. I want everyone to be knowledgable with where things are going and how to circumvent what is to come. I will contine to make modern sites that people won't have to scan and re-train themselves on how to flow around the site.  Truth... I don't have any real world experience except for my dad's non-profit.  I am trying to change this by getting my master in Web Design.  I want to make people happy with taking their business to new places.</p>
